# Azure End-To-End Adventure Data Engineering Project
In this end to end project I have used the following:
 - GitHub 
 - Azure Data Factory
 - Azure Databricks
 - Azure Synapse Analytics
 - Microsoft PowerBi

I collected adventure data from kaggle and pushed the data to github account, from github I created an HTTP connection with Azure Data Factory inorder to load the data to ADLS Gen 2 (which a connection was also created) in Azure.
